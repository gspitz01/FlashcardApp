# FlashcardApp
FlashcardApp is a simple application which allows a user to learn subjects using randomly selected flashcards. The user can also add or edit flashcards. Currently works with a local backend via Retrofit.

The code is heavily based on the Google MPV clean Todo Sample App: https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture
